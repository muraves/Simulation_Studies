DTM of Vesuvius

This directory contains the DTM of Vesuvius at 1m resolution, cut on a regular
grid 5000x3600 pixels. The quotes are referred to the EGM2008 geoid (ie: they
are referred to the mean sea level).

Two formats are provided:

File: vesuvio_Lidar_EGM2008_5000x3600.xyz.zip
Ascii file (x, y, z), coordinates UTM WGS84 zone 33T, quotes in meters above
sea level, zipped.

The DTM was realized after a Lidar flight in 2009 (sparse points with quotes
referred to the WGS84 ellipsoid).

The original Lidar DTM was resampled on a regular grid after a Delaunay
triangulation, with quotes referred to the EGM2008 geoid (by G.Macedonio).

The DTM can be cited as: "1-m-grid Digital Terrain Model (DTM) produced by
processing of a very high-resolution airborne LiDAR data set acquired in 2009
by the Province of Naples Council in the framework of the CECOSCA Project
(Vilardo et al, 2013)."

or, more simply:
"Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of Vesuvius crater (Vilardo et al, 2013)"
