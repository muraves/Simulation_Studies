The results are expected flux from observation point MURAVES. The 3 digital in the file name indicate the density of the rock when defining the geometry, e.g. <fluxGiovanni265> means the rock density is defined homogenously as 2.65 g/cm3. 

The data sets is in the form of:
<Azimuth Angle>   <Elevation Angle>  <expected flux (per m-2 per second)>
 
Note that:
The Azimuth angel coordinate is different from MURAVES data, by -136. Elevation angle is consistent. 
Please convert the unit of the flus as desired, e.g. you can get (per m-2 per day) if multiply 86000.
